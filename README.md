# Bouncing-Ball

Bouncing Ball is a 3D environment game using OpenGL. The main game idea is that there is a bouncing ball shot into a cuboid room.
The roomâ€™s walls are formed of differently colored bricks. The ball bounces between these walls with normal reflections,
and free from any gravity or other forces than the initial shooting force.
